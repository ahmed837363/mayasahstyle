## ðŸš€ Next Steps - Deploy to Azure

### Step 1: Push to GitHub (DONE âœ…)
```powershell
git push origin master
```

### Step 2: Follow Azure Deployment Guide
Open **AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md** and follow these parts:

1. **Part 1**: Deploy Website to Azure Static Web Apps (15 min)
2. **Part 2**: Create Azure Function for Orders (20 min)
3. **Part 3**: Setup Azure Communication Services for Emails (15 min)
4. **Part 4**: Get Appwrite API Key (5 min)
5. **Part 5**: Configure Azure Function Settings (5 min)
6. **Part 6**: Update Website (already done, just push)
7. **Part 7**: Setup Custom Domain mayasahstyle.me (10 min)

**Total Time: ~70 minutes**

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Reference

### Your Azure Setup Details

**Custom Domain:** mayasahstyle.me

**Azure Services:**
- Static Web Apps (website hosting)
- Azure Functions (order processing)
- Azure Communication Services (email sending)

**Appwrite (Database):**
- Endpoint: https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
- Project ID: 68eb3e280039fdf7e677
- Database ID: 68eb4036002db50c7171
- Collections: products, orders

---

## ðŸ’¡ Important Notes

### Email Configuration
- Azure Communication Services will send emails
- Sender: `DoNotReply@[your-domain].azurecomm.net`
- Owner receives at: mayasahstyle@gmail.com
- Customers receive invoices automatically

### Cost Estimate
- Static Web Apps: FREE (first 100 GB bandwidth)
- Azure Functions: FREE (first 1M requests)
- Communication Services: $0.0025 per email
- **Total for small store: ~$0.13/month** ðŸ’°

### What Happens When Order Placed
1. Customer fills checkout form
2. Order sent to Azure Function (`/api/processOrder`)
3. Function saves to Appwrite database
4. Function sends email to customer (invoice)
5. Function sends email to you (notification)
6. Customer sees confirmation page

---

## ðŸ”§ Development vs Production

### Testing Locally (Before Azure)
```powershell
# Run local Azure Functions
cd api
npm start
```

Function runs at: `http://localhost:7071/api/processOrder`

### Production (After Azure Deployment)
Function runs at: `https://mayasahstyle.me/api/processOrder`

The code in `checkout.js` automatically detects and uses the right URL! âœ…
